## H04 - Polymorphism
### Esther Ajuwon
### Description:

Polymorphism is a key principle in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of 
a common base class. It comes in different formsâ€”most notably compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) 
and runtime polymorphism (method overriding). This assignment focuses on understanding when and why 
polymorphism is used, along with a minimal demonstration.
