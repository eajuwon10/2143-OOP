## H03 - Inheritance
### Esther Ajuwon
### Description:

Inheritance is another fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows you to create new 
classes (derived classes) based on existing ones (base classes), enabling reusability, extensibility, and a 
clearer hierarchy of types. This assignment focuses on why and how to use inheritance in practical scenarios.
