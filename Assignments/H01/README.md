## H01 - Classes & Objects
### Esther Ajuwon
### Description:

In this assignment, you will explore the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), 
focusing on the structure and behavior of classes and objects. You will begin by understanding what a class 
is and how to create (instantiate) objects from it. You will then investigate the role of constructors and 
destructors in managing the object lifecycle — from creation to cleanup — and examine how memory and 
resources are handled during this process.
The assignment will also include designing a simple class in code, where you will implement and demonstrate 
these concepts through a minimal yet functional example. This hands-on component will solidify your 
understanding by allowing you to apply what you’ve learned in a practical context.
